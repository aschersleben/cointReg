Description: Cointegration methods are widely used in empirical macroeconomics
    and empirical finance. It is well known that in a cointegrating
    regression the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the
    parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to the
    sample size T . When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting
    distribution of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second
    order bias terms, see e.g. Phillips and Hansen (1990). The presence
    of these bias terms renders inference difficult. Consequently,
    several modifications to OLS that lead to zero mean Gaussian mixture
    limiting distributions have been proposed, which in turn make
    standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include
    the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen
    (1990), the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips and Loretan
    (1991), Saikkonen (1991) and Stock and Watson (1993) and the new estimation
    approach called integrated modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang and Wagner
    (2014). The latter is based on an augmented partial sum (integration)
    transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS is similar in spirit to the
    FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference that it does not require
    estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids the need to choose
    tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However, inference does
    require that a long run variance be scaled out.
    This package provides functions for the parameter estimation and inference
    with all three modified OLS approaches. That includes the automatic
    bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) and of Newey and West
    (1994) as well as the calculation of the long run variance.
